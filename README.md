# Chris Keneally

I’m a PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide (Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology). I'm studying microbial ecology & biogeochemistry - and I'm relatively new to github, metagenomics & bioinformatics. So please contact me with any questions/clarification on anything here!
